            Globalization establishes domestic organizations in foreign countries through the free movement of capital, trade, information, culture,
            people, etc. Moreover, it is a business expansion phenomenon allowing mobilization of resources amongst nations to ensure their optimum
            utilization for global growth.Globalization initiates growth and interconnectivity of various sectors across nations. Its essential
            features include the cross-border connectivity or integration, free trade environment and interdependency of nations. In addition, it
            facilitates global business expansion, cross-culture diversification, lower tariffs and taxes on international business operations.
            Migration of workforce and international investments create job opportunities, enhanced goods and services as well economic development.

            A global economy is an economic interdependence established between the most influential countries that drives the worldwide economic
            environment. It is also the aggregate economic output, movement and influence of all countries. <br /><br />
            The global economy can be defined as each individual country’s economy added together but that is not the only way to portrait how the
            world economy works. The 20th largest economies account for 80% of the world’s economic output and the five biggest economies are big
            enough to impact the whole world with their developments. If one of these five economies suffer from a natural disaster or any event that
            causes an economic downturn it will have sequels on the global economy due to the interconnections caused by international trade.

            Market integration is a term that is used to identify a phenomenon in which markets of goods and services that are somehow related to one
            another being to experience similar patterns of increase or decrease in terms of the prices of those products. The term can also refer to
            a situation in which the prices of related goods and services sold in a defined geographical location also begin to move in some sort of
            similar pattern to one another. At times, the integration may be intentional, with a government implementing certain strategies as a way
            to control the direction of the economy. At other times, the integrating of the markets may be due to factor such as shifts in supply and
            demand that have a spillover effect on several markets.

            Asian regionalism is characterized by a nondiscriminatory and outward-oriented approach that allows its members to thrive in the global
            economy. Asian regionalism is therefore essential in the world economy because it promotes free trade, improves economic conditions, paves
            the way for the creation of employment opportunities, and, most importantly, because it develops economic policies that serve the
            interests of the entire region and advance economic progress. Asian regionalism economies have grown large and rich enough to be
            considered indispensable in the world economy as a result of the Asian economic integration process. It is impossible to ignore the fact
            that Asian countries are thriving in terms of economic development. It is making progress not only in terms of economic conditions, but
            also in terms of implementing measures that will eradicate, or at the very least mitigate, the effects of global warming. The long-term
            cycle of poverty in Asia has been deteriorating as a result of the increased number of work possibilities that have been created, as well
            as the ability of people to live a life that meets their basic necessities on a daily basis

            Since globalization is an uneven process, it creates imbalance in the socio-economic and political categories of the world. The world is
            divided into (1) north and south, and (2) first, second, and third world. These two sets of division or concepts are used interchangeably
            in common conversation because they are related but are actually different.The Global Division has the opportunity to encourage global
            leaders to develop global voices and shareexperiences and needs through a common and diverse vision for the future of our world as well as
            globalprofession.The global North refers to developed societies of Europe and North America, which arecharacterized by established
            democracy, wealth, technological advancement, political stability, agingpopulation, zero population growth and dominance of world trade
            and politics. The global South represents main ly agrarian economies in Africa, India, China, Latin America andothers that are not as
            economically sound and politically stable as their global North counterparts andtend to be characterized by turmoil, war, conflict,
            poverty, anarchy and tyranny (Odeh, 2010). In short,the global North is synonymous with development, while the global South is associated
            withunderdevelopment

            Global governance brings together diverse actors to coordinate collective action at the level of the planet. The goal of global
            governance, roughly defined, is to provide global public goods, particularly peace and security, justice and mediation systems for
            conflict, functioning markets and unified standards for trade and industry. One crucial global public good is catastrophic risk management
            – putting appropriate mechanisms in place to maximally reduce the likelihood and impact of any event that could cause the death of 10 per
            cent of humanity across the planet, or damage of equivalent magnitude.
